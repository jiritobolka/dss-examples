=============

Sample CloudConnect project using the Agile Data Warehousing Service (ADS)

The _Sample ADS Project_ includes two graph:
- `ADS_Minimal.grf` is a minimal demonstration of using the ADS
in CloudConnect with a ADS connection, DBExecute components
for creating a table and loading data and a DBInputTable
component for querying the database.
- `ADS_Merge.grf` shows a more realistic example of loading data
into DSS using a staging table and the `MERGE` command
- `ADS_Row_Version_History.grf` demonstrates the data structures,
loading processes and export queries for a project that involves
maintaining the full history of changes
