=============

Sample CloudConnect project using the DataWarehousing Service (DWHS)

The _Sample DWHS Project_ includes two graph:
- *DWHS_Minimal.grf* is a minimal demonstration of using the DWHS
in CloudConnect with a DWHS connection, DBExecute components
for creating a table and loading data and a DBInputTable
component for querying the database.
- *DWHS_Merge.grf* shows a more realistic example of loading data
into DWHS using a staging table and the {{MERGE}} command
